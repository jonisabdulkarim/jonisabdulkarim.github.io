    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> 
        I am a graduate student, with a passion in software engineering.
        The languages I mostly code on are, in order of preference, Java, C++ and Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I prefer back-end programming, I am starting to learn more
        about front-end development. I will be re-learning HTML and CSS and, most
        importantly, JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am working on my own projects, 
        which you can take a look at on my 
        <a href="https://github.com/jonisabdulkarim" title="My GitHub account page.">
            GitHub page
        </a>. 
        One of the projects includes making this very page :)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>
        I graduated from Essex University with a first class degree on BSc Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose the course after I began self-learning Python. Since I began studying, I 
        thoroughly enjoyed programming as well as designing systems.
        This led me to pick up modules that are heavily based on creating my own projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The projects I've completed while at uni are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Asteroids</li>
        <li>Tetris</li>
        <li>DraughtsOnline</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So lots of games! You can probably guess what my favourite hobby used to be.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        When I'm not working on my projects, I like spending my time practising the
        keyboard and reading history books.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to enjoy playing games, especially MOBAs such as Dota 2 and grand strategy
        games, including Hearts of Iron 4. Nowadays I don't play much.
